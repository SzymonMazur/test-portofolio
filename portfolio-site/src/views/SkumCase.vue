          <strong>Skum</strong> is a <strong>mobile application </strong>that I
          and two other students created as part of our interaction design exam.
          We designed this project from <strong>start</strong> to
          <strong>final design </strong> through ideation, reasearch and UX
          design principals. Since no similar
          <strong>Norwegian application</strong> has been made before, our
          <strong>goal</strong> was to design a platform where beer enthusiasts
          can discover new beer and share their discoveries with friends.

                  one of the most popular beer/drink application on the market, and found that they provide a lot of information about beer and
                  that they operate <strong>worldwide</strong>. This can be <strong>overwhelming</strong> for some users, especially those living in Norway.</p>
        <p class="about-projext-txt">The analysis also provided us inspiration to some important <strong>key</strong> functions we should implement in our solution.

          Once we created the conceptual model and the sitemap, the next step was to start <strong>wireframing.</strong>

          them several <strong>follow-up questions,</strong> including about how they feel about the app in general. All of the tests were

      <p class="about-projext-txt">This was my first UX gorup project and <strong>working with others</strong> may be difficult sometimes, everyone has
        their own ideas and sometime it my be hard to let them go. One of our <strong>first challeges</strong> was deciding on how
        we sould <strong>communicate</strong> and <strong>collaborate</strong> with each other.  We decided to meet several times a week and talk 
        through our toughts and ideas, and we made use of <strong>Discord</strong> to communicate when we were at home. </p>

      <p class="about-projext-txt">In the <strong>beginning</strong> we spent much time  deciding ideas- until one of the group members suggested a elimination technique. <strong>Nobody 
        took charge</strong> and we spent unnecessary much time on unimportant talking and doing other things. We also spent a lot of time working together instead
        of <strong>allocating</strong> work tasks.  </p>

      <p class="about-projext-txt">When you work in groups its <strong>important</strong> to let every teammember to pitch their own

              be a usability test, it can be a survey or a Guerrilla testing. One of the most <strong>important</strong> things is to 
              gain <strong>insight</strong> into what the users think and why. It is for the <strong>users</strong> we are going to create a
